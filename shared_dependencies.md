Shared Dependencies:

1. **Python (with Flask):** All the files are written in Python and use Flask for backend development.

2. **Langchain (LLMS):** Used in the communication layer, it's a shared dependency across all agents and endpoints.

3. **Chroma DB:** The database used across all agents for storing and retrieving data.

4. **User ID:** A common parameter used in all the agents and endpoints for identifying the user.

5. **Goals:** Used in both the Survey Analysis Agent and Time Agent for task generation and tracking.

6. **Survey Data:** Used in the Survey Analysis Agent for analyzing and storing goals.

7. **Message:** Used in the Chat Interface Agent for providing task guidance.

8. **Chat Data:** Used in the Chat Interface Agent for storing chat history.

9. **Configurations:** Shared across all files, defined in `config.py`.

10. **Unit Tests:** Shared testing methodology across all test files.

11. **Docker:** Used for deployment, configurations shared in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

12. **Function Names:** Certain function names like `get_task_completion_percentage(user_id)` and `store_goal_in_database(user_id, goals)` are shared across different agents.

13. **Endpoints:** The API routes (`survey_endpoint.py`, `task_tracking_endpoint.py`, `chat_interface_endpoint.py`) are shared across different agents for communication.

14. **Requirements.txt:** Shared dependencies file for all Python packages required in the project.

15. **README.md:** Shared documentation for all files and their functionalities.
